# The following sections tell mypy to ignore missing imports for certain libraries.
# If a library doesn't have type hints (or "stub files"), mypy can't check the types
# of any objects that come from that library. By ignoring missing imports, we can
# prevent mypy from raising an error in this case.

# Note that this means mypy won't be able to check the types of any objects that come
# from these libraries, so we're losing some of the benefits of static typing for those
# parts of our code. We should only add these settings for libraries that we're certain
# don't have type hints or stub files.

# Ignore missing imports from the following packages: setuptools, langchain, paperqa, paperscraper, pypdf, rmrkl
[mypy-setuptools.*, langchain.*, paperqa.*, paperscraper.*, pypdf.*, rmrkl.*]
