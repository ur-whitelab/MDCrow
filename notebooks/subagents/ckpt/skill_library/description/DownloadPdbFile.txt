This tool downloads a PDB file from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) website.
The function takes a PDB ID as input and checks if a JSON file containing the PDB IDs exists.
If the JSON file does not exist, it prompts the user to enter a PDB ID.
The function then uses the PDB ID to construct a URL and sends a GET request to download the PDB file.
The downloaded file is saved with the same name as the PDB ID and returned as the output.
Finally, the function prints the path to the downloaded file.
