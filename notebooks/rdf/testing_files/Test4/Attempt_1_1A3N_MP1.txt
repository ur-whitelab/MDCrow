Query from the user: Simulate 1A3N in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves multiple steps. First, I need to clean the protein 1A3N to prepare it for simulation. After cleaning, I will set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein in water at 280K. I will start by cleaning the protein using the CleaningToolFunction.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1A3N",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The previous attempt to clean the protein 1A3N failed because the file was not found. I will need to download the PDB file for the protein 1A3N before attempting to clean it again.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1A3N"
  }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1A3N
No names found. The JSON file is empty or does notcontain name mappings.
Now that I have successfully downloaded the PDB file for protein 1A3N, I can proceed to clean it using the CleaningToolFunction. This will prepare the protein for the simulation by removing heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, and replacing nonstandard residues.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1A3N_220117",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}

The protein 1A3N has been successfully cleaned. The next step is to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein in water at 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task. The simulation will require solvation of the protein in water, setting the temperature to 280K, and using an appropriate forcefield. I will configure the system to solvate the protein, use a cutoff periodic nonbonded method with a reasonable cutoff distance and constraint tolerance, and set the integrator parameters to reflect the desired temperature.
