Query from the user: Calculate the radial distribution function of 1PQ2 at 280K with water

Thought: To calculate the radial distribution function (RDF) of the protein 1PQ2 at 280K with water, I would need to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein in a water box at the specified temperature. After equilibrating the system, I could then analyze the trajectory to compute the RDF. However, the tools provided do not include a direct method for calculating RDFs. The closest tool available is the SetUpandRunFunction, which can set up and run a short simulation, but it does not directly calculate RDFs. I will use this tool to set up the simulation environment first.
