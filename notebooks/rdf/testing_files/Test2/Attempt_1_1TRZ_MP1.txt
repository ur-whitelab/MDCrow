Query from the user: Simulate 1TRZ in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task requires simulating the protein with PDB ID 1TRZ in water at 280K. Before running the simulation, the protein structure needs to be cleaned. The first step is to download and clean the protein structure. After that, I will set up and run the simulation with the specified temperature.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1TRZ",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The previous attempt to clean the protein structure failed because the file was not found. It seems that the PDB ID provided might not be available in the current path registry or there was an issue with accessing the file. The first step is to ensure that the PDB file for 1TRZ is available and downloaded correctly before attempting to clean it.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1TRZ"
  }
}
```
PDB file found with this ID: 1TRZ
Now that the PDB file for 1TRZ has been successfully downloaded, the next step is to clean the protein structure using the CleaningToolFunction. This will involve removing heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, replacing nonstandard residues, and removing water molecules that are not part of the desired simulation environment.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1TRZ_135258",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein structure has been successfully cleaned. The next step is to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation of the cleaned 1TRZ protein in water at the specified temperature of 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task, ensuring to adjust the temperature parameter accordingly and to solvate the system with water.

Action:
```

  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1TRZ_135311",

      "rigidWater": true,
      "constraintTolerance": 0.00001,
      "solvate": true
    },
    "integrator_params": {
      "integrator_type": "LangevinMiddle",
      "Temperature": "280 * kelvin",
      "Friction": "1.0 / picoseconds",
      "Timestep": "0.002 * picoseconds"
    },
    "simmulation_params": {
      "Ensemble": "NVT",
      "Number of Steps": 5000,
      "record_interval_steps": 50,
      "record_params": ["step", "potentialEnergy", "temperature"]
    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup failed because the ewaldErrorTolerance parameter was not specified, which is required when using the PME nonbonded method. I will correct this by adding the ewaldErrorTolerance parameter to the system_params and then reattempt the simulation setup and run.
