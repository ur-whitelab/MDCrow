Query from the user: Simulate 1BO9 in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves simulating the protein with PDB ID 1BO9 in water at 280K. Before running the simulation, I need to clean the protein structure by removing heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, replacing nonstandard residues, and removing water. After cleaning, I will set up and run the simulation in a water environment at the specified temperature. I will use the CleaningToolFunction to clean the protein and then the SetUpandRunFunction to simulate the protein in water at 280K.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1BO9",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```Thought: The previous attempt to clean the protein with PDB ID 1BO9 failed because the file was not found. I need to download the PDB file for the protein 1BO9 before I can clean it. I will use the PDBFileDownloader tool to download the PDB file for 1BO9.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1BO9"
  }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1BO9
Now that the PDB file for 1BO9 has been successfully downloaded, I can proceed with cleaning the protein structure. I will use the CleaningToolFunction to clean the protein by removing heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, replacing nonstandard residues, and removing water. This step is necessary to prepare the protein for simulation.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1BO9_145547",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein with PDB ID 1BO9 has been successfully cleaned and is now ready for simulation. The next step is to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation in a water environment at the specified temperature of 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task, ensuring that the system is solvated and the temperature is set to 280K.

    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup failed because the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter was not specified, which is required when using the PME (Particle Mesh Ewald) method for the nonbonded interactions. I will correct this by adding the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter to the system parameters and then reattempt the simulation setup.

Cannot neutralize the system because the charge is greater than the number of available positions for ions
