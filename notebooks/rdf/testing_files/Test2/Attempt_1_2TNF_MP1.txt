Query from the user: Simulate 2TNF in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves multiple steps: cleaning the protein 2TNF, setting up a simulation environment with water, adjusting the temperature to 280K, and running the simulation. I will start by cleaning the protein using the CleaningToolFunction.

Action:
```json
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "2TNF",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The previous attempt to clean the protein 2TNF failed because the file was not found. It's possible that the PDB ID was incorrect or the file is not available in the current path registry. I will use the PDBFileDownloader tool to download the PDB file for the protein 2TNF before attempting to clean it again.

Action:
```json
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "2TNF"
  }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 2TNF
Now that the PDB file for 2TNF has been successfully downloaded, I will proceed to clean the protein using the CleaningToolFunction with the correct file path.

Action:
```json
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "2TNF_145335",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein 2TNF has been successfully cleaned. The next step is to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of 2TNF in water at 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task, ensuring that the system is solvated with water and the temperature is set to 280K.

Action:
```json
{
  "action": "SetUpandRunFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "2TNF_145347",
    "forcefield_files": ["amber14-all.xml", "amber14/tip3pfb.xml"],
    "save": true,
    "system_params": {

      "constraints": "HBonds",
      "rigidWater": true,
      "constraintTolerance": 0.00001,
      "solvate": true
    },
    "integrator_params": {
      "integrator_type": "LangevinMiddle",
      "Temperature": "280 * kelvin",
      "Friction": "1.0 / picoseconds",
      "Timestep": "0.002 * picoseconds"
    },
    "simmulation_params": {
      "Ensemble": "NVT",
      "Number of Steps": 5000,
      "record_interval_steps": 50,
      "record_params": ["step", "potentialEnergy", "temperature"]
    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup failed because the ewaldErrorTolerance parameter was not specified, which is required when using the PME nonbonded method. I will correct this by adding the ewaldErrorTolerance parameter to the system_params and then reattempt the simulation setup.

    },

    }
  }

The molecular dynamics simulation of the protein 2TNF in water at 280K has been successfully completed. The simulation parameters were set correctly, and the simulation ran for the specified number of steps. The task is now complete.

Final Answer: The molecular dynamics simulation of the cleaned protein 2TNF in water at 280K has been successfully set up and executed. The simulation parameters included the use of the PME nonbonded method with an ewaldErrorTolerance of 0.0005, constraints on hydrogen bonds, rigid water molecules, and a Langevin integrator with a temperature of 280K. The simulation ran for 5000 steps, and data such as step number, potential energy, and temperature were recorded at intervals of 50 steps. The simulation results can be analyzed to study the behavior of 2TNF at the specified temperature in an aqueous environment.
