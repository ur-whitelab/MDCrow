Query from the user: Simulate 2RH1 in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves multiple steps: cleaning the protein 2RH1, setting up a molecular dynamics simulation environment with water, and running the simulation at 280K. The first step is to clean the protein using the CleaningToolFunction. After cleaning, I will set up and run the simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool, ensuring the temperature is set to 280K and the system is solvated with water.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "2RH1",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```Thought: The previous attempt to clean the protein 2RH1 failed because the file was not found. This suggests that the PDB file for 2RH1 needs to be downloaded before it can be cleaned. I will use the PDBFileDownloader tool to download the PDB file for 2RH1.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "2RH1"
  }
}
```
PDB file found with this ID: 2RH1
Now that the PDB file for 2RH1 has been successfully downloaded, the next step is to clean the protein using the CleaningToolFunction. This will prepare the protein for the simulation by performing operations such as replacing nonstandard residues, adding missing atoms, removing heterogens, and adding hydrogens.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "2RH1_143227",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein 2RH1 has been successfully cleaned and is now ready for simulation. The next step is to set up the molecular dynamics simulation environment. This involves solvating the protein in water and running the simulation at the specified temperature of 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task, ensuring to set the temperature to 280K and to solvate the system with water.

    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup failed because the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter was not specified, which is required when using the PME (Particle Mesh Ewald) method for the nonbonded interactions. I will correct this by adding an `ewaldErrorTolerance` value to the `system_params` and re-run the simulation setup using the SetUpandRunFunction tool.
