Taking out subagents

Query from the user: You already have a simulation of 2RH1 in water at 280K. Please use the dcd records and topology files of the simulation to make a plot of the rdf between water and the protein

Thought: To create a plot of the radial distribution function (RDF) between water and the protein from a molecular dynamics simulation, I need the trajectory file (typically a .dcd file) and the topology file (such as a .psf or .pdb file) of the simulation. Once I have these files, I can use the RMSDCalculator tool to calculate the RDF, as this tool can handle trajectory and topology files and perform various analyses. However, I need to confirm if the RMSDCalculator tool can specifically calculate RDF, as RDF is not explicitly mentioned in the tool's description. If the RMSDCalculator cannot calculate RDF, I may need to use a different approach or tool.

Action: RMSDCalculator
Action Input: {
  "rmsd_type": "rdf",
  "pdb_file": "2RH1_topology.pdb",
  "trajectory": "2RH1_simulation.dcd",
  "selection": "protein and water"
}
