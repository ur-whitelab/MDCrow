Query from the user: Simulate 1A3N in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task is to simulate the protein with PDB ID 1A3N in water at 280K. Before running the simulation, the protein needs to be cleaned. The first step is to download the PDB file for 1A3N, then clean it using the CleaningToolFunction, and finally set up and run the simulation with the SetUpandRunFunction tool, ensuring the temperature is set to 280K and the system is solvated with water.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1A3N"
  }
}
```
PDB file found with this ID: 1A3N
Now that the PDB file for 1A3N has been downloaded, the next step is to clean the protein using the CleaningToolFunction. This will involve removing heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, replacing nonstandard residues, and removing water. After cleaning, the protein will be ready for simulation.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1A3N_134913",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein with PDB ID 1A3N has been successfully cleaned and is now ready for simulation. The next step is to set up and run the simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool. The simulation should be performed in water at a temperature of 280K. The system parameters will need to be adjusted to include solvation, and the integrator parameters will need to be set to the desired temperature.

```error found: constraintTolerance must be specified if rigidWater is True
 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup was not successful because the constraint tolerance was not specified, which is required when `rigidWater` is set to `True`. I will correct this by adding a `constraintTolerance` value to the system parameters and then reattempt the simulation setup.

 Correct this and try again.
