Query from the user: Calculate the radial distribution function of 1TRZ at 280K with water

Thought: To calculate the radial distribution function (RDF) of the protein 1TRZ with respect to water molecules, I need to first set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of 1TRZ at 280K, ensuring that the system is solvated with water. After the simulation is complete, I can then use the RDFTool to calculate the RDF. The first step is to set up the simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool.

  }

```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
To correct the error, I need to include the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter in the `system_params` since the `nonbondedMethod` is set to PME. I will adjust the `action_input` for the `SetUpandRunFunction` tool accordingly.

Action:
```json
{
  "action": "SetUpandRunFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1TRZ",
    "forcefield_files": ["amber14-all.xml", "amber14/tip3pfb.xml"],
    "save": true,
    "system_params": {
      "nonbondedMethod": "PME",
      "nonbondedCutoff": "1.0",
      "constraints": "HBonds",
      "rigidWater": true,
      "constraintTolerance": 0.00001,
      "solvate": true,
      "ewaldErrorTolerance": 0.0005
    },
    "integrator_params": {
      "integrator_type": "LangevinMiddle",
      "Temperature": "280 * kelvin",
      "Friction": "1.0 / picoseconds",
      "Timestep": "0.002 * picoseconds"
    },
    "simmulation_params": {
      "Ensemble": "NVT",
      "Number of Steps": 5000,
      "record_interval_steps": 50,
      "record_params": ["step", "potentialEnergy", "temperature"]
    }
  }
}
```The error indicates that the `pdb_id` provided is not recognized. It seems that I need to download the PDB file for 1TRZ using the PDBFileDownloader tool before I can proceed with the simulation setup.

Action:
```json
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1TRZ"
  }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1TRZ
Names found in registry: 1A3N_142822, 1A3N_142901, top_sim0_142921, sim0_142921, rec0_142923, rec1_142923
Now that I have the PDB file for 1TRZ, I can proceed with setting up and running the molecular dynamics simulation using the correct file ID for 1TRZ. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool("Connection broken: InvalidChunkLength(got length b'', 0 bytes read)", InvalidChunkLength(got length b'', 0 bytes read))
