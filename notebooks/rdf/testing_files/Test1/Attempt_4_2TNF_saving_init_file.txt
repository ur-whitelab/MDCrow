Query from the user: Simulate 2TNF in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves simulating the protein 2TNF in water at a temperature of 280K. Before running the simulation, I need to clean the protein, which involves removing any unwanted molecules, adding missing atoms, and possibly adding hydrogens. After cleaning, I will set up and run the simulation. I will use the PDBFileDownloader to obtain the protein file, the CleaningToolFunction to clean the protein, and then the SetUpandRunFunction to simulate the protein in water at the specified temperature.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "2TNF"
  }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 2TNF
Now that I have the PDB file for 2TNF, the next step is to clean the protein using the CleaningToolFunction. This will involve removing any unwanted molecules such as heterogens, adding missing atoms, and adding hydrogens, which is necessary before setting up the molecular dynamics simulation.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "2TNF_151440",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein 2TNF has been successfully cleaned, and I now have the cleaned PDB file. The next step is to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation of 2TNF in water at 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task, ensuring that I specify the temperature as 280K and that the system is solvated with water.

    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup requires an `ewaldErrorTolerance` value because the `nonbondedMethod` is set to PME (Particle Mesh Ewald). I will add this parameter to the system parameters and re-run the SetUpandRunFunction tool to initiate the molecular dynamics simulation of 2TNF in water atHTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.openai.com', port=443): Read timed out.
