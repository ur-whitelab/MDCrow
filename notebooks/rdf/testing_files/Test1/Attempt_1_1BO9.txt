Query from the user: Simulate 1BO9 in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves simulating a protein (1BO9) in water at a specific temperature (280K). Before running the simulation, the protein structure needs to be cleaned. The first step is to download the protein structure file using its PDB ID. Then, I will clean the protein using the CleaningToolFunction. After that, I will set up and run the simulation with the specified temperature and in the presence of water using the SetUpandRunFunction.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1BO9"
  }
}
```

PDB file found with this ID: 1BO9
The PDB file for the protein 1BO9 has been successfully downloaded. The next step is to clean the protein structure using the CleaningToolFunction. This will involve removing any heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, replacing nonstandard residues, and removing water molecules that may be present in the crystal structure. After cleaning, the protein will be ready for simulation.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1BO9_143249",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein structure has been cleaned successfully, and I now have the cleaned PDB file. The next step is to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation of the cleaned protein in water at the specified temperature of 280K. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task. I will need to specify the system parameters to include solvation and set the temperature to 280K in the integrator parameters.

    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup failed because the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter was not specified, which is required when using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method for handling long-range electrostatic interactions. I need to include this parameter in the system settings and retry the simulation setup.
