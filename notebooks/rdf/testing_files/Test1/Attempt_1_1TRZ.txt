Query from the user: Simulate 1TRZ in water at 280K. Dont forget to clean the protein first

Thought: The task involves simulating a protein, 1TRZ, in water at 280K. Before running the simulation, the protein structure needs to be cleaned. The first step is to download the PDB file for 1TRZ using the PDBFileDownloader tool. After obtaining the file, I will use the CleaningToolFunction to clean the protein. Once the protein is cleaned, I will set up and run the simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool, ensuring that the temperature is set to 280K and the system is solvated with water.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1TRZ"
  }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1TRZ
Now that the PDB file for 1TRZ has been successfully downloaded, the next step is to clean the protein structure. This involves removing any heterogens, adding missing atoms and hydrogens, replacing nonstandard residues, and removing water molecules that may be present in the crystal structure. I will use the CleaningToolFunction to perform these tasks.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "CleaningToolFunction",
  "action_input": {
    "pdb_id": "1TRZ_132453",
    "replace_nonstandard_residues": true,
    "add_missing_atoms": true,
    "remove_heterogens": true,
    "remove_water": true,
    "add_hydrogens": true,
    "add_hydrogens_ph": 7.0
  }
}
```The protein 1TRZ has been cleaned successfully, and I now have the cleaned PDB file. The next step is to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform the simulation. I need to ensure that the temperature is set to 280K, the system is solvated with water, and the appropriate forcefield is applied. I will also make sure to set the system parameters to include a water model suitable for the simulation.

    }
  }
}
```error found: ewaldErrorTolerance must be specified when
            nonbondedMethod is PME

 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
The simulation setup encountered an error because the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter was not specified, which is required when the `nonbondedMethod` is set to PME (Particle Mesh Ewald). I will correct this by adding the `ewaldErrorTolerance` parameter to the system parameters and then reattempt the simulation setup using the SetUpandRunFunction tool.

The molecular dynamics simulation of the protein 1TRZ in water at 280K has been successfully completed after cleaning the protein and setting the correct simulation parameters, including the ewaldErrorTolerance for the PME nonbonded method. The simulation ran for 5000 steps with recording intervals of 50 steps, capturing data on the step number, potential energy, and temperature throughout the simulation.

Final Answer: The simulation of protein 1TRZ in water at 280K has been successfully completed. The cleaned protein structure was used, and the simulation parameters were set to include a Particle Mesh Ewald nonbonded method with an ewaldErrorTolerance of 0.0005, hydrogen bonds constraints, rigid water model, and Langevin integrator with a temperature of 280K. The simulation ran for 5000 steps, and data was recorded at 50-step intervals.
