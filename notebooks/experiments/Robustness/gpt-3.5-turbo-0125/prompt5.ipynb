      "Final Answer: After multiple attempts to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation for the protein with PDB ID 1XQ8, I encountered persistent issues with the simulation setup, specifically related to the compatibility of the PDB file with the selected force field (amber99sb.xml). Despite cleaning the PDB file multiple times to remove water molecules and heterogens, the simulation failed due to missing templates for certain residues. This indicates a possible issue with the force field compatibility or the integrity of the PDB file itself. Therefore, I was unable to complete the simulation and subsequently could not analyze changes in the secondary structure of the protein. Further investigation into the appropriate force field or a more thorough cleaning and preparation of the PDB file may be necessary to proceed with the simulation successfully."
