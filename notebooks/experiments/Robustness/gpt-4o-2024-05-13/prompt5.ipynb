They started by downloading the file, preprocessing it by adding missing atoms and replacing non-standard residues, and analyzing the initial secondary structure. After simulating for 1 ps at 300 K, they analyzed the secondary structure again and found a significant increase in the number of helices, strands, and coils. The comparison showed that the number of helices increased from 83 to 24876, strands from 2 to 214, and coils from 55 to 16910. This indicates substantial structural changes during the simulation.
