      "Final Answer: The secondary structure of the protein 1XQ8 changed significantly during the 1 picosecond simulation at 300K. The number of residues in helices, strands, and coils increased substantially.The agent attempted to solve the problem of the changing secondary structure of protein 1XQ8 during a simulation. Before the simulation, the protein had 83 residues in helices, 2 residues in strands, and 55 residues in coils. After the simulation, there was a drastic change with 1237 residues in helices, 20 residues in strands, and 843 residues in coils. This significant increase in the number of residues in each secondary structure element indicated a notable change in the protein's secondary structure. The final solution was that the secondary structure of protein 1XQ8 underwent a significant transformation during the 1 picosecond simulation at 300K, with a substantial increase in the number of residues in helices, strands, and coils.Your run id is:  E6D5R2CV\n"
