The RMSD plots were saved with specific plot IDs, and the RMSD data was saved to CSV files with corresponding file IDs. The secondary structure comparison showed a decrease in helical residues and an increase in coil residues at the higher temperature (400K), indicating some structural destabilization. The agent concluded that the RMSD plots can be used to analyze stability and conformational changes over time, and the secondary structure analysis provided insights into the structural changes between the two simulations.Your run id is:  M9FDMPRC\n"
