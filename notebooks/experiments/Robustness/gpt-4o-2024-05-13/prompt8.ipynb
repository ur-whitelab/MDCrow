      "Final Answer: The molecular dynamics tasks have been successfully completed. The simulations at 300 K, 400 K, and 500 K were run, the radius of gyration was plotted, and the secondary structures were analyzed for each simulation. The results are summarized above.The agent successfully completed simulations at 300 K, 400 K, and 500 K, and analyzed the radius of gyration and secondary structures for each simulation. The results showed variations in secondary structures at different temperatures, with the highest number of helices observed at 500 K. The agent also saved a plot of the radius of gyration. Overall, the molecular dynamics tasks were completed successfully, providing valuable insights into the behavior of the system at different temperatures.Your run id is:  1Q5B3RI1\n"

       "('The DSSP computations for the simulations at 100K, 200K, and 300K have been completed. Here are the results:\\n\\n- **100K:**\\n  - Helix: 4108\\n  - Strand: 40215\\n  - Coil: 55277\\n\\n- **200K:**\\n  - Helix: 4019\\n  - Strand: 39968\\n  - Coil: 55613\\n\\n- **300K:**\\n  - Helix: 3381\\n  - Strand: 39720\\n  - Coil: 56499\\n\\nNext, I will summarize the findings and provide the final answer.\\n\\nFinal Answer: The simulations for 4RMB at 100K, 200K, and 300K for 1 ps each have been successfully completed. The radius of gyration over time for each simulation has been plotted, and the change in secondary structure has been analyzed.\\n\\n### Radius of Gyration Plot:\\nThe plot of the radius of gyration over time for all three simulations is saved as `FIG_rgy_4RMB_20240719_225644.png.png`.\\n\\n### Secondary Structure Analysis:\\n- **100K:**\\n  - Helix: 4108\\n  - Strand: 40215\\n  - Coil: 55277\\n\\n- **200K:**\\n  - Helix: 4019\\n  - Strand: 39968\\n  - Coil: 55613\\n\\n- **300K:**\\n  - Helix: 3381\\n  - Strand: 39720\\n  - Coil: 56499\\n\\n### Comparison:\\n- As the temperature increases from 100K to 300K, there is a noticeable decrease in the number of helical structures and strands, while the number of coil structures increases. This indicates that higher temperatures lead to a loss of secondary structure stability, resulting in more random coil formations.\\n\\nThe results provide insights into the structural stability of the protein 4RMB at different temperatures.',\n",
