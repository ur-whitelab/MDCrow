      "Final Answer: The PDB files for proteins 8PFK and 8PFQ were successfully downloaded and cleaned. The cleaned 8PFK structure contains 487 atoms, 109 residues, 2 chains, 1 frame, and 420 bonds, while the cleaned 8PFQ structure contains 950 atoms, 194 residues, 6 chains, 1 frame, and 833 bonds. The secondary structure analysis using the ComputeDSSP tool indicated no helices, strands, or coils for either protein, with 11 residues not assigned as protein residues for 8PFK and 22 for 8PFQ after cleaning. This is an unusual result and suggests that the proteins may not have typical secondary structures or there may be an issue with the DSSP analysis for these structures. Further investigation may be required to understand the nature of these proteins and the accuracy of the secondary structure assignments."
