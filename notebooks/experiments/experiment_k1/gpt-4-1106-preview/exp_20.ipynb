      "The attempt to set up the simulation in the methanol environment failed because periodic boundary conditions were requested for a topology that does not specify periodic box dimensions. This indicates that the system setup requires explicit box dimensions to be defined when using periodic boundary conditions. To resolve this, I need to ensure that the box dimensions are correctly set in the system parameters. Since the packmol_tool was used to create a box with dimensions 90x90x90 Å, I will include these dimensions in the system_params and attempt the simulation setup again using the SetUpandRunFunction tool.\n",

The agent identified that the system_params input \"boxSize\" was not being recognized by the SetUpandRunFunction tool, indicating a need for a different parameter name or format.
