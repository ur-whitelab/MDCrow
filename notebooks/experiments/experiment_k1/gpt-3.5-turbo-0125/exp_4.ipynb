However, based on the available PDB information, fibronectin structures have been resolved using methods like NMR and X-ray, with resolutions ranging from 1.20 A to 3.32 A. The chains involved in these structures vary in length and composition, indicating the complexity of fibronectin's structural organization. Additionally, specific regions like Anastellin, Ugl-Y1, Ugl-Y2, and Ugl-Y3 have been identified within the fibronectin sequences, providing insights into potential functional domains. These details can guide the selection of parameters for simulating fibronectin, considering the structural diversity and functional regions present in the protein."
