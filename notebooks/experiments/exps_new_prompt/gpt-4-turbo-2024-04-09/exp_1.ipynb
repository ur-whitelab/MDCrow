This is a complex molecular dynamics problem requiring specific computational tools and expertise in protein simulations.\n",

      "**Steps Taken:**\n",
      "1. **Thought:** The agent needed to consider the best approach to simulate the protein at different temperatures, analyze the RMSD, and compare secondary structures. This would involve selecting appropriate molecular dynamics simulation software, setting up the simulation environment, running the simulations, analyzing the data, and interpreting the results.\n",

      "- **Final Answer:** The agent should have provided a detailed comparison of the RMSD plots and a thorough analysis of the differences in secondary structures at 300K and 400K. This would include observations on stability, structural changes, or any notable differences induced by the temperature variations.\n",
