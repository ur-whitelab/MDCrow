      "   - Preparing the molecular system by obtaining the structure from a database like PDB.\n",
      "   - Choosing an appropriate force field for potential energy calculations.\n",
      "   - Defining the simulation box, solvating the system, and adding ions if needed.\n",

      "3. **Final Solution**: The agent did not provide a 'Final Answer' format response as the output did not contain the results of the simulation or the comparison of the final secondary structures at the different temperatures. Instead, the agent provided a detailed description of the steps involved in setting up and running a molecular dynamics simulation, which is a precursor to solving the problem but not the solution itself.\n",

      "Additional Relevant Details:\n",
      "- The agent's response indicates an understanding of the molecular dynamics simulation process but does not show the execution of the specific task.\n",
      "- The response does not include the actual simulation data, RMSD plots, or comparison of secondary structures, which are required to complete the task.\n",
      "- The agent may need to perform the simulations using appropriate software tools and then analyze the results to provide the 'Final Answer.'\n",
