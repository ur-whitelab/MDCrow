For constraining bonds to hydrogen atoms, the SHAKE algorithm is commonly used with a relative geometrical tolerance of 10^(-6) Å (Salomón-Ferrer2013RoutineMM pages 28-29; Lee2015CHARMMGUIIG pages 2-3). In the context of temperature control, the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm is often employed with a time constant of τT = 10.0 ps (Salomón-Ferrer2013RoutineMM pages 28-29). It is worth noting that different algorithms, such as simple algorithms and predictor-corrector algorithms, can be used for integrating the equations of motion in MD simulations (González2011ForceFA pages 16-17). However, the specific integration algorithm used for the AMBER force field is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources.\n",
