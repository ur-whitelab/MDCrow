      "Common time steps and integration algorithms used in MD simulations with the AMBER force field are not explicitly provided in the given sources. However, it is mentioned that Verlet integrators are simple, efficient, stable, and time-reversible, making them a good choice for MD simulations (González2011ForceFA pages 16-17). The time step used in simulations depends on the system being simulated, with a typical value of 5 fs for simulating a Lennard-Jones fluid such as argon close to the triple point (González2011ForceFA pages 16-17).\n",
