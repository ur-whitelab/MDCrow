      "In AMBER force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the choice of time steps and integration algorithms is crucial for balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. The Verlet integrator is a commonly used algorithm in MD simulations due to its simplicity, efficiency, stability, and time-reversibility (González2011ForceFA pages 16-17). Typical time steps for simulating a Lennard-Jones fluid such as argon close to the triple point are 5 fs, while for simulating flexible molecules, the time step needs to be small enough to model correctly the fastest intramolecular vibrational motions, usually 0.5-1 fs (González2011ForceFA pages 16-17). Although the provided sources do not specifically discuss time steps and integration algorithms in the context of AMBER force field MD simulations, these general principles are likely to apply in that context as well.\n",
